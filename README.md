The blog is supposed to be navigable and interlinked: clicking on a tag brings up a list of posts matching that tag, and clicking on a category pulls up a list of posts that are part of that category. 

The posts are just filler material so that there's something to show.

Below is a visual Demo of what the blog looks like
